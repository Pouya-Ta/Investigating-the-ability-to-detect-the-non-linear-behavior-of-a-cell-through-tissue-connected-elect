Our main method is to calculate the second and third harmonics of the current produced by the membrane and calculate the amount of voltage that results from this activity.

In this issue, we want to investigate the ability to detect the nonlinear behavior of a cell through electrodes attached to the tissue. Our main method is to calculate the second and third harmonics of the current produced by the membrane and calculate the voltage value that can be recorded by the electrode as a result of this current activity on the membrane.

This project can be done with different software and tools. In this project, we have carried out our activities with the help of Python programming language and in Pycharm software and programming environment. This project can also be done with the help of MATLAB software.
